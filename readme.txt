SelectiveAsset

Version: 0.0.1beta
Author: Brandon Him (@brandonhim)
--------------------

SelectiveAssets is a simple extra that allows you to selectively decide when you want to load a particular JS or CSS file. This can boost overall site performance as developers can prevent a user from loading a particular file only unless required. In addition, SelectiveAssets has additional parameters for maintaining your coding standards.

Feel free to optimize existing code or contribute at github/brh55/selectiveassets

Future development: Support of multiple files.
